    <p>
        Currently samples of the remaining number of critical bugs and tasks
        against Drupal 8 are manually polled from Drupal.org.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Monte Carlo simulation is then run on the polled data to estimate the
        time required to complete the currently remaining number of issues.
        Currently a flat distribution is used to select samples, but once more
        samples are available recent results will be weighted more heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
        An additional 6 weeks is then added to the estimate to account for the
        Release Candidate period.
    </p>
